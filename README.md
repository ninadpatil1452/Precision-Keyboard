# PrecisionPointer Research Application

A comprehensive iOS research application designed to evaluate the effectiveness of precision text selection methods on mobile devices. This project implements and tests "PrecisionPointer" - a novel interaction paradigm for accurate text selection on touchscreens.

## üìã Project Overview

Standard text selection on mobile touchscreens often suffers from the "fat finger" problem, where users' fingers occlude the text they're trying to select, leading to frequent errors and poor user experience. PrecisionPointer addresses this by introducing a gesture-activated precision mode that provides magnified text selection capabilities.

### Research Hypothesis
> PrecisionPointer will demonstrate statistically significant improvement in both speed and accuracy for precision-oriented tasks and will receive higher subjective satisfaction ratings compared to standard text selection methods.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### iOS Application (SwiftUI)
- **Main App**: `Precision_KeyboardApp.swift` - Entry point and app configuration
- **Root View**: `RootView.swift` - Navigation and study flow management
- **Study Session**: `StudySessionStore.swift` - Task management and data collection
- **Precision Editor**: Complete precision mode implementation with magnified text selection
- **SUS Survey**: System Usability Scale questionnaire for user satisfaction

### Backend Server (Go)
- **Data Collection**: REST API for collecting comprehensive metrics
- **CSV Export**: Automated data export for statistical analysis
- **Session Management**: Participant tracking and counterbalancing

## üöÄ Features

### Enhanced Precision Mode
- **Gesture Activation**: Long-press to activate precision mode
- **Full-Screen Magnification**: 3x text magnification for accurate selection
- **Persistent Mode**: Release finger to continue selecting from magnified view

### Advanced Data Collection
- **25+ Metrics**: Comprehensive performance tracking including:
  - Task completion time and accuracy
  - Gesture analysis (taps, long-presses, drags)
  - Precision mode usage patterns
  - Selection accuracy scores
  - Error rates and correction patterns
- **SUS Survey**: Standardized usability assessment
- **Real-time Logging**: Detailed console output for monitoring
